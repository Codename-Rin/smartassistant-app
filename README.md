This is more like "i don't know what I'm doing" app. Requirements were for angular but there was no angular files in the zip package so I worked out of context. Recruiter told me that I can use ReactJS and try to mimic the required behaviour. So I did the best I could. The app renders question pages from JSON source with Axios request. Single page and it's questions are rendered together with title and text, you can navigate between pages and also filter with the button. The code can be way more modular and optimised, state can be hold by redux etc. Doable if given more time.
